what is MLOPS and why is it necessary 

how do you implement MLOPS 

MLOPS tools to explore : research each of these in more depth 

- Docker Compose: Define and run multi-container Docker applications.
  
- Kubernetes: Orchestrate and manage containerized applications.
  
- MLflow: Track experiments, manage models, and streamline ML lifecycle.
  
- Airflow: Schedule and manage ML workflows.
  
- Prometheus/Grafana: For application and model monitoring.



What Do Deployed ML Models Do?

Deployed ML models allow you to use machine learning capabilities in real-world applications by making the model accessible to other software, systems, or users via an interface like an API.

Classification Models:
Example: A spam detection model deployed as an API can evaluate incoming emails and classify them as spam or not spam in real-time.


Regression Models:
Example: A house price prediction model can provide instant price estimates for input features like size or location.

Why deploy ml models 
- Real-Time Predictions:
Deployed models allow other applications or users to get predictions in real-time by sending requests (e.g., an app calling an API to classify a user-uploaded image).

- Integration with Other Systems:
Once deployed, models can be integrated into larger systems like mobile apps, web services, or IoT devices. For example:
E-commerce: Product recommendation systems.
Healthcare: Predicting disease risks from patient data.

- Scalability:
Deployment systems (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) make it easier to handle larger traffic. For instance:
A stock price prediction API can handle thousands of requests per second during trading hours.

- Continuous Updates:
Deployed systems often allow for versioning and updating models without disrupting user experience.
For example, you can retrain your model with new data and replace the old one seamlessly.
