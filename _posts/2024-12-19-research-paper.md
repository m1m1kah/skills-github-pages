In this blog post i am going to write about the different components of a research paper and how to summarise research papers. 
This is so i can look back on this and start reading more research . 

**1. Title**

Concise and informative.
Reflects the focus of the paper (e.g., a new algorithm, dataset, or application).

**2. Abstract**

A brief summary of the entire paper.
Includes:
The problem being addressed.
The method or approach proposed.
Key results and contributions.
Typically 150â€“250 words.

**3. Introduction**

Context and Motivation: Why is this problem important?
Problem Statement: Clearly define the problem being tackled.
Contributions: List the main contributions of the paper (e.g., a novel algorithm, theoretical insights, experimental results).
Structure: Briefly outline the rest of the paper.

**4. Related Work / Literature Review**

Review of previous research relevant to the problem.
Identify gaps, limitations, or shortcomings in prior work.
Position your contribution in the context of existing literature.

**5. Methodology / Proposed Approach/ maths and algorithms** 

- Detailed description of the proposed method, model, or framework.
  
- Include:
  
- Mathematical formulations (if applicable).
  
- Assumptions made.
  
- Pseudocode or algorithm (if introducing a new one).
  
- Architectural details (for deep learning models).
  
- Explain how your approach differs from or improves upon existing methods.

**6. Experiments**

- Datasets: Description of datasets used (size, preprocessing, etc.).

- Baseline Comparisons: List of baseline methods or benchmarks used for comparison.

- Experimental Setup: Hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, hardware/software environment.

- Results: Present empirical results (e.g., accuracy, loss, convergence rates).

- Ablation Studies (optional): Analyze the contribution of individual components of your method.

- Visualization: Graphs, tables, or charts to support results.

**7. Results and Discussion**

Discuss key findings from the experiments.
Compare with baseline methods and prior work.
Address unexpected outcomes or limitations.
Provide insights into why the method performs well (or poorly).

**8. Conclusion**
Summarize the key contributions and findings.
Discuss broader implications or applications of the work.
Mention future directions or open questions.
